# CMD_FFMPEG_APP

Code Written and created by Austin Tyler 2024.

This class is a very basic set of common instructions for the popular framework 'FFMPEG'. 

Initially, I was using XABE's C# FFMPEG wrapper, however after many headaches and issues with running FFMPEG instructions with XABE I decided to create my own. 

Full disclosure, I am in no way a professional programmer
and to consider me anything close to a novice would be a complement, so keep that in mind when reading through this class. 

Feel free to edit, add or remove methods to your heart's content and hopefully you find this as useful as I have.

That being said, you will need FFMPEG executable installed on your machine. (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

This is a wrapper that will periodically be updated depending on what features I need to add, however, I am in favor of letting this be open source so others can add additional functionality.
